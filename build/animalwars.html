It was more of a pain than I anticipated. Particularly zoom.</p><p>These are pretty key/necessary elements of any strategy game, so it was about time they made it in. I was cheating using keyboard controls in Unity before, but it's time to start eating our own dogfood.</p><p>The zoom feels a little fast to me but it's something I will play with in the future.</p><p>I also changed the HPs of most of the units to better reflect what I think will be balanced at the beginning of the game. They might progress somehow, but I'm not sure I like the idea of them having 'levels' .</p></div></header></section><section class="job_history"><header class="row-fluid"><div class="job-brief span7"><h4 class="position"><div class="bullet"></div><b>Time for a fresh new look.</b></h4></div><div class="row-fluid preview"><div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(70.80% + 44px)"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="100%" scrolling="no" src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/DefiantCavernousButterfly?autoplay=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;" width="100%"></iframe></div></div><div class="row-fluid span10"><p>I've been working on improving the UI I started a while ago.

They are more or less advanced placeholders.</p><p>Right now there are wayyyy too many arrows. We are currently thinking of a solution to that.</p><p>The monkey is also being refined and is almost ready to actually put in the game.</p></div></header></section><section class="job_history"><header class="row-fluid"><div class="job-brief span7"><h4 class="position"><div class="bullet"></div><b>From the front to the back to the top of the block</b></h4></div><div class="row-fluid preview"><div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(70.80% + 44px)"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="100%" scrolling="no" src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/SpryLargeAltiplanochinchillamouse?autoplay=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;" width="100%"></iframe></div></div><div class="row-fluid span10"><p>It's been a while between updates.

Right now this visual treatment is very temporary, as we are going to overhaul the trap appearance AND the preview.</p><p>Those buttons are also temporary. So temporary.</p></div></header></section><section class="job_history"><header class="row-fluid"><div class="job-brief span7"><h4 class="position"><div class="bullet"></div><b>It's ok, Jiorny.

I don't think we will have any penguin as dark as Steve: these are all jokeholders and definitely not making it into the final game.
