This is showing off the turn bar.</p><p>You can click the turn bar to move around the map. You can click the ready/attack buttons to switch between previewing your ready action and attacking your opponent.</p><p>We removed the Move button because we realized it was more or less the default ( and superfluous ).</p><p>The attack and 'ready' buttons are going to to change majorly, so I haven't bothered with animations. They are more or less advanced placeholders.</p><p>Right now there are wayyyy too many arrows. We are currently thinking of a solution to that.</p><p>The monkey is also being refined and is almost ready to actually put in the game.</p></div></header></section><section class="job_history"><header class="row-fluid"><div class="job_brief span7"><h4 class="position"><div class="bullet"></div><b>From the front to the back to the top of the block </b></h4></div><div class="row-fluid preview"><div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay="false" data-controls="true" data-id="SpryLargeAltiplanochinchillamouse" data-responseive="true"></div></div><div class="row-fluid span10"><p>It's been a while between updates. I've been working hard on a preview system.</p><p>A core element of a lot of strategy games is a little bit of a heads up regarding the result of an action.</p><p>I really like the idea of being able to pull complex combos off - like hitting an enemy to your buddy and having him hit the enemy over you - but sometimes it gets to be a little too much to process.</p><p>I wanted something that would give a physical representation of the motion in each action. Right now this visual treatment is very temporary, as we are going to overhaul the trap appearance AND the preview.</p><p>Those buttons are also temporary. So temporary.</p></div></header></section><section class="job_history"><header class="row-fluid"><div class="job_brief span7"><h4 class="position"><div class="bullet"></div><b>It's ok, Jiorny.

I don't think we will have any penguin as dark as Steve: these are all jokeholders and definitely not making it into the final game. But they are funny for me while I develop.</p><p>Also shows the push mechanic. Your penguin will shove the unit / do more damage based on his distance from the unit.</p></div></header></section><section class="job_history"><header class="row-fluid"><div class="job_brief span7"><h4 class="position"><div class="bullet"></div><b>Monkey Work </b></h4></div><div class="row-fluid preview"><div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay="false" data-controls="true" data-id="AlarmedEnchantedFawn" data-responseive="true"></div></div><div class="row-fluid span10"><p>Working on a new projectile for the Monkey unit.
