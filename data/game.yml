      - "I added zoom and drag controls for phone and the PC. It was more of a pain than I anticipated. Particularly zoom."
      - "These are pretty key/necessary elements of any strategy game, so it was about time they made it in. I was cheating using keyboard controls in Unity before, but it's time to start eating our own dogfood."
      - "The zoom feels a little fast to me but it's something I will play with in the future."
      - "I also changed the HPs of most of the units to better reflect what I think will be balanced at the beginning of the game. They might progress somehow, but I'm not sure I like the idea of them having 'levels' ."

      - "I've been working on improving the UI I started a while ago. This is showing off the turn bar."
      - "You can click the turn bar to move around the map. You can click the ready/attack buttons to switch between previewing your ready action and attacking
        your opponent."
      - "We removed the Move button because we realized it was more or less the default ( and superfluous )."
      - "The attack and 'ready' buttons are going to to change majorly, so I haven't bothered with animations. They are more or less advanced placeholders."
      - "Right now there are wayyyy too many arrows. We are currently thinking of a solution to that."
      - "The monkey is also being refined and is almost ready to actually put in the game."

      - "It's been a while between updates. I've been working hard on a preview system."
      - "A core element of a lot of strategy games is a little bit of a heads up regarding the result of an action."
      - "I really like the idea of being able to pull complex combos off - like hitting an enemy to your buddy and having him hit the enemy over you - but sometimes it gets to be a little too much to process."
      - "I wanted something that would give a physical representation of the motion in each action. Right now this visual treatment is very temporary, as we are going to overhaul the trap appearance AND the preview."
      - "Those buttons are also temporary. So temporary."

      - "I am experimenting with a new biome. We are going to start making some new environments soon. The walls are terrible, I'm sorry."
      - "This is kind of showing off the combo preview mechanic (in progress ). Not 100% sure on how the menu on the bottom is working, but its also a work in progress"
      - "There's also a new attack animation for the penguin combo, which you can see here. I think it still needs some work."
      - "The beginning of the video is a little abrupt, but I'm trying to work with gfycat right now. Might have to switch to a WebM service."

    description: 
      - "I removed the button panel when you select enemies. At first I was thinking there might be some interesting 'mode' stuff to do there, but it ends up being very confusing."
      - "For now I have put in a description. I don't think we will have any penguin as dark as Steve: these are all jokeholders and definitely not making it into the final game. But they are funny for me while I develop."
      - "Also shows the push mechanic. Your penguin will shove the unit / do more damage based on his distance from the unit."

      - "Working on a new projectile for the Monkey unit. Not quite sure about the strength + range of the bomb yet, but I kind of like the idea of him causing a lot of chaos."
      - "You'll notice a turn bar at the top that is glitching out a bit. It's because this is in a testing harness and not in a live scene."
      - "The camera bounces around a lot because it doesn't quite know about bombs yet."

      - "Working on the first UI pass. The menus are still pretty rough."
      - "Here we are showing selecting a unit and then attacking them."
      - "There's a bug here w/ the NICE! callout. It shouldn't be appearing underneath the wall."
