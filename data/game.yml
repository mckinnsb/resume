      - "It's been a while between updates. I've been working hard on a preview system."
      - "A core element of a lot of strategy games is a little bit of a heads up regarding the result of an action."
      - "I really like the idea of being able to pull complex combos off - like hitting an enemy to your buddy and having him hit the enemy over you - but sometimes it gets to be a little too much to process."
      - "I wanted something that would give a physical representation of the motion in each action. Right now this visual treatment is very temporary, as we are going to overhaul the trap appearance AND the preview."
      - "Those buttons are also temporary. So temporary."

      - "I am experimenting with a new biome. We are going to start making some new environments soon. The walls are terrible, I'm sorry."
      - "This is kind of showing off the combo preview mechanic (in progress ). Not 100% sure on how the menu on the bottom is working, but its also a work in progress"
      - "There's also a new attack animation for the penguin combo, which you can see here. I think it still needs some work."
      - "The beginning of the video is a little abrupt, but I'm trying to work with gfycat right now. Might have to switch to a WebM service."

      - "I removed the button panel when you select enemies. At first I was thinking there might be some interesting 'mode' stuff to do there, but it ends up being very confusing."
      - "For now I have put in a description. I don't think we will have any penguin as dark as Steve: these are all jokeholders and definitely not making it into the final game. But they are funny for me while I develop."
      - "Also shows the push mechanic. Your penguin will shove the unit / do more damage based on his distance from the unit."

      - "Working on a new projectile for the Monkey unit. Not quite sure about the strength + range of the bomb yet, but I kind of like the idea of him causing a lot of chaos."
      - "You'll notice a turn bar at the top that is glitching out a bit. It's because this is in a testing harness and not in a live scene."
      - "The camera bounces around a lot because it doesn't quite know about bombs yet."

      - "Working on the first UI pass. The menus are still pretty rough."
      - "Here we are showing selecting a unit and then attacking them."
      - "There's a bug here w/ the NICE! callout. It shouldn't be appearing underneath the wall."
